= Stuff to do

* finish conversion of archives to _posts/
* Move footer into template (or menu)
* Diverge from default layout for archives?
** give more head space (remove information less relevant for people there)
** prepend: "Archive: " to page's title
* link in footer to https://github.com/montrehack/montrehack.github.com/wiki/Sponsorships-at-Montrehack
* agree on and document the standard tags for posts (and stick to them)
** ex: status: FIXME
** presenter tag? would be nice and low effort
